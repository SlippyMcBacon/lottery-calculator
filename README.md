I am a recent college grad who has spent the past three months developing a project that has found the best game to play based on secret tables found in the menus.

If you didn't know already, by wiggling through several menus, there are odds tables for almost every game, including all the pricepoints and the odds of winning all possible prizes at those price points. Using this information, I was able to create a Python script that analyzes every table of every game to accurately determine the best game, based on four key statistics.

Stat 1: Return to player (RTP)
The percentage of your money that the game will return to you on average over time. Calculated by multiplying all the prizes and the odds of a pricepoint together, then adding them up and dividing by the pricepoint.

Stat 2: Win Chance (WR)
The percentage chance you have of winning any prize. Calculated by adding up all the odds.

Stat 3: Limit return to player (LimRTP)
The return to player using all the outcomes more likely than 1 in 100/1% chance. Calculated like RTP but only on certain odds.

Stat 4: Most Likely Return (MLR)
The return to player using the most likely outcome. Calculated like RTP, but on the most likely outcome

Common misconception:
Every price point of a game has the same RTP. So on most games, you have the same odds of 10X-ing your money at the $.10 pricepoint as the $50 pricepoint. The only thing that changes in some games between pricepoints is your odds of winning the jackpot, but not by much. The average jackpot is a 1 in 2,000,000/.00005% chance at the $1 pricepoint and scales at the same rate as the pricepoints so at the $2 price point, you have double the chance to win (1 in 1,000,000/.0001% chance). But at a $50 pricepoint thats still only a 1 in 40,000/.0025% chance of winning a jackpot.

I don't want to make this college essay length, so here are the best games in each of the stats individually, then all the stats together as a whole, depending on what stats you value more as a person or your personal strategy.

Best Return To Player: Million Dollar Countdown in power hour mode
90.0% RTP, 24.85% WC, 13.1% LimRTP, 2.75% MLR, $.5 - $50

Best Win Chance: Big Day Payday
86.99% RTP, 33.47% WC, 35.1% LimRTP, 9.5% MLR, $.10 - $20

Best Limit Return To Player: Champion's Gold
87.0% RTP, 21.1% WC, 71.22% LimRTP, 10.67% MLR, $.20 - $10

Best Most Likely Return: Lotto Virginia
87.4% RTP, 19.74% WC, 60.89% LimRTP, 33.67% MLR, $1 - $4

Adding all percentages together: Lotto Virginia
87.4% RTP, 19.74% WC, 60.89% LimRTP, 33.67% MLR, $1 - $4

Weighted based on what values I think are most important
RTP = x .3 WR = x .1 LimRTP = x .5 MLR = x .7
also Lotto Virginia lol when you start up the game it defaults to $4 spins just be aware

The reason Lotto Virginia is the clear winner here is that you have a 1 in 5.94/16% chance to double your money and a 1 in 36.74/2.72% chance to 10x your money, which is better odds than in a lot of games, even to get your money back. And unlike most games each row is a separate $1 ticket

But the min bet for Lotto Virginia is $1, which is a lot compared to the $.2 min bet of most games, so to maximize return to player, I recommend playing the second-best game

Drop It: 87% RTP, 18.6% WC, 56.4% LimRTP, 22.4% MLR with all 10 balls on the lowest cost per ball

I hope this information is useful, as it took a lot of time to compile all the necessary data for this project. May the odds be ever in your favor.
